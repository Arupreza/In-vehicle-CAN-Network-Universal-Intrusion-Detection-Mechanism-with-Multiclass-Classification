# In-vehicle-CAN-Network-Universal-Intrusion-Detection-Mechanism-with-Multiclass-Classification

The controller area network has always been vulnerability prone because of its manufacturing process. There are several intrusion detection systems (IDS) proposed but still, there is a big drawback that is for a vehicle, if the vehicle is changed data generation process also changes even on the same vehicle company. For that reason, the proposed conventional can not detect attacks for every vehicle. According to conventional IDS, every vehicle needs to design IDS individually which is immensely difficult and time-consuming. For solving this issue, here proposed a universal approach that can detect attacks for every vehicle and classify which type of attack it is.
